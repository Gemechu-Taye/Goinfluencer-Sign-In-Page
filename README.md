# Goinfluencer-Sign-In-Page

Internship application with GOinfluencer.

As part of the GOinfluencer internship process, I'm required to submit a short assignment. Please find the details of the assignment below:

I have to design a simple responsive web page that is in the design using Html and CSS. Feel free to use your creativity on it and make it responsive.
Upload your assignment at Codepen.io and share the link on or before 31/03/22 (Thursday) EOD

Due to the subscription edition of codepen.io, I used Github to access the project upload, and I've attached the design of the short assignment below. Thanks!
